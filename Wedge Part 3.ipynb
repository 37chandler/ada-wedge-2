    "## Task 3: Building Summary Tables\n",
    "It is useful to have summary files that allow you to quickly answer questions such as the following:\n",
    "•\tHow have our sales-by-day changed over the last few months?\n",
    "•\tWhat is our most popular item in each department?\n",
    "•\tWhich owners spend the most per month in each department?\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic way to structure data to answer these questions is in a relational database. In this task, you will build the summary text files that hold this data and populate a relational database with the data.\n",

    "Deliverable: The Python code that creates the summary tables. The Python code that builds the database. The actual database file (.db)."
